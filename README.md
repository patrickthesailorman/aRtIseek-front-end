We tried to take a minimalist approach, to contain scope creep, and to ensure we had a working example that met the basic requirements. Also that it was built in a way that would be easily scalable and that we could build it app and add more to it later.

unsolved problems or major hurdles:
  - We Have a great project, with great structure. It's all there for the most part. Not everything is hooked up though. Having some issues with routes, that will be quickly solved. Final touches in styling will do much to bring some beauty to this beast.

Installation instructions:
- Back end deployed on Heroku
- Front end is on Github pages
